# Product Requirements Document
## Spanish NES Compliance Chatbot System

## 1. Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Organizations implementing Spanish NES (Esquema Nacional de Seguridad) compliance face challenges in understanding and completing complex security questionnaires. The ENS framework requires detailed information across multiple security domains, and organizations struggle to provide complete, accurate responses without guidance.

### Solution Overview
An intelligent chatbot system that guides users through ENS compliance questions in Spanish, dynamically asks follow-up questions to gather complete information, validates responses against ENS requirements, and stores structured data in JSON format for compliance reporting.

### Success Metrics
- 95% completion rate for ENS question sequences
- 90% reduction in time to complete ENS assessments
- 85% user satisfaction with chatbot guidance quality
- 100% data completeness for answered questions

## 2. Business Context

### Market Opportunity
- Spanish public sector organizations required to implement NES compliance
- Private organizations adopting ENS as security framework
- Consulting firms providing ENS assessment services
- Internal compliance teams requiring guided assessment tools

### Competitive Landscape
- Manual ENS assessment questionnaires
- Generic compliance chatbots without ENS specialization
- Consultant-led assessment processes
- Static form-based compliance tools

### Strategic Alignment
- Democratizes ENS compliance knowledge
- Reduces dependency on specialized consultants
- Standardizes ENS assessment processes
- Enables self-service compliance workflows

## 3. User Personas and Use Cases

### Primary Users
- **Compliance Officers**: Complete ENS assessments for their organizations
