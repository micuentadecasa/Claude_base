# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose
This is a template repository for building domain-specific applications using Claude Code. It provides a structured approach to feature development with comprehensive testing and LLM monitoring, adaptable to any domain or use case.

## Streamlined Development Workflow

### Core Commands (Token-Efficient with Parallel Agents)
```bash
# 1. Enhance PRD (One-time)
claude-code commands/prd-enhance.md

# 2. Setup Environment (One-time)  
claude-code commands/env-setup.md

# 3. Plan Features (Parallel planning of 2 features at once)
claude-code commands/feature-plan.md

# 4. Implement Features (Parallel implementation of 2 steps at once)
claude-code commands/feature-implement.md
```

### Intelligent Progress Tracking
- **Smart Resume**: Commands automatically detect what's already done
- **Parallel Agents**: Launches up to 2 Claude agents simultaneously
- **Token Efficient**: Each command focuses on one specific task
- **Dependency Aware**: Prevents conflicts and ensures correct order

### Development Flow Examples
```bash
# Complete project setup (run once)
claude-code commands/prd-enhance.md     # âœ… Enhances PRD with detailed features
claude-code commands/env-setup.md       # âœ… Creates project structure in src/

# Feature planning (run until all planned)
claude-code commands/feature-plan.md    # ðŸš€ðŸš€ Plans 2 features in parallel
claude-code commands/feature-plan.md    # ðŸš€ðŸš€ Plans next 2 features
claude-code commands/feature-plan.md    # ðŸš€ Plans final feature

# Feature implementation (run until all implemented)  
claude-code commands/feature-implement.md  # ðŸš€ðŸš€ Implements 2 steps in parallel
claude-code commands/feature-implement.md  # ðŸš€ðŸš€ Continues with next 2 steps
# ... repeat until all features complete
```

### Smart Progress Awareness
```bash
# Commands know current state
claude-code commands/env-setup.md
# Output: "âœ… Environment already set up. Ready for feature planning."

claude-code commands/feature-plan.md  
# Output: "âœ… All features planned. Ready to implement: feature_001, feature_002"

claude-code commands/feature-implement.md
# Output: "ðŸš€ðŸš€ Implementing parallel steps: feature_001.step_003, feature_004.step_002"
```

### Parallel Agent Management
- **Automatic Detection**: Finds parallelizable work automatically
- **Conflict Prevention**: Ensures agents work on safe combinations
- **Progress Coordination**: Merges results from parallel agents
- **Dependency Management**: Respects feature and step dependencies

## Architecture Overview

### SOLID Architecture Pattern
The codebase follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ features/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ feature_XXX/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ domain/          # Business logic and entities
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entities/
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repositories/
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ services/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ application/      # Use cases and application logic
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ use_cases/
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dto/
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ interfaces/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/   # External dependencies
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ adapters/
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ clients/
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ presentation/     # Controllers and UI
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ validators/
â””â”€â”€ shared/
    â”œâ”€â”€ llm/                 # LLM integration layer
    â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
    â””â”€â”€ exceptions/
```

### LLM Integration Standards
- **LiteLLM**: All LLM calls use LiteLLM with configurable LLM providers
- **LangWatch Scenario**: Comprehensive testing and monitoring for LLM interactions
- **Environment Variables**: API keys stored in `.env` file
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for LLM service failures
- **Testing**: Agent-based scenario testing with automatic simulation

### Data Processing Architecture
- **Data Ingestion**: Configurable processors for various data formats (JSON, CSV, XML, etc.)
- **Business Logic**: Domain-specific validation and processing rules
- **Quality Assurance**: Data validation and quality checks
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive handling of corrupted/malformed data

## Testing Strategy

### Test Structure
```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/           # Isolated component tests
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/    # Service integration tests
â”œâ”€â”€ e2e/           # End-to-end workflow tests
â”œâ”€â”€ performance/   # Load and performance tests
â””â”€â”€ llm_validation/ # LLM prompt and response quality tests
```

### LLM Testing Requirements
- **LangWatch Scenario Integration**: Monitor all LLM calls during testing using scenario library
- **Prompt Validation**: Ensure prompts produce consistent results
- **Response Quality**: Validate accuracy against expected outcomes
- **Domain-Specific Testing**: Specific testing for your domain terminology and requirements

### Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints and service interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Data processing under load

## Development Guidelines

### Feature Development Process
1. **Analyze PRD**: Use `feature-creator.md` to break down requirements
2. **Generate Tests**: Create comprehensive test datasets
3. **Implement**: Follow SOLID principles with dependency injection
4. **Test**: Execute full test suite with LLM monitoring
5. **Track**: Update progress and documentation

### Code Quality Standards
- **SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
- **Dependency Injection**: All dependencies injected through constructors
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with custom exceptions
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring

### LLM Development Best Practices
- **API Key Management**: Always use environment variables
- **Monitoring**: Enable LangWatch for all LLM calls
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when LLM services fail
- **Prompt Engineering**: Validate prompts against test datasets

## Context Management

### Efficient Development Sessions
- Use `context-manager.md` to load relevant context for specific features
- Switch between features efficiently without conversation bloat
- Compress context when sessions become too large
- Start fresh sessions with essential context only

### Progress Tracking
- Real-time progress monitoring across all features
- Quality gates for code coverage, LLM accuracy, and performance
- Blocker identification and resolution tracking
- Automated progress reporting

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
YOUR_LLM_API_KEY=your_preferred_llm_api_key  # e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, etc.
LANGWATCH_API_KEY=your_langwatch_api_key
# Add other API keys relevant to your domain
```

### Development Dependencies
