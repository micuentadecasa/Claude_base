# PRD Enhancement Command

## Purpose
Transform a pre-PRD or basic requirements document into a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) with well-defined, idempotent, independent, and testable features.

## Command Usage
```bash
claude-code commands/c00-prd-enhancer.md [--input=path_to_pre_prd] [--output=enhanced_prd.md]
```

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Input Analysis
1. **Read the existing pre-PRD or requirements document**
   - If `--input` parameter provided, read from specified file
   - Otherwise, read from `ens_prd.md` or any existing PRD-like document
   - If no document exists, prompt user for basic requirements

2. **Analyze current content structure**
   - Identify business objectives
   - Extract functional requirements
   - Note technical constraints
   - Identify stakeholders and users

### Step 2: Feature Definition Framework
Apply the following criteria to define features:

#### Idempotent Features
- Each feature produces the same result regardless of how many times it's executed
- Features have clear entry and exit conditions
- State changes are predictable and consistent

#### Independent Features
- Features can be developed, tested, and deployed separately
- Minimal coupling between features
- Clear interfaces and contracts between features
- No shared mutable state between features

#### Testable Features
- Each feature has measurable acceptance criteria
- Features include specific input/output scenarios
- Performance and quality metrics are defined
- Edge cases and error conditions are specified

### Step 3: Enhanced PRD Structure
Create a comprehensive PRD with the following sections:

```markdown
# Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary
- Problem statement
- Solution overview
- Success metrics

## 2. Business Context
- Market opportunity
- Competitive landscape
- Strategic alignment

## 3. User Personas and Use Cases
- Primary users
- User journeys
- Pain points addressed

## 4. Feature Specifications

### Feature XXX: [Feature Name]
#### Business Value
- User value proposition
- Business impact metrics

#### Functional Requirements
- Core functionality
- User interactions
- Data flow

#### Technical Requirements
- Performance criteria
- Security requirements
- Integration points

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Specific, measurable outcomes
- Test scenarios
- Edge cases

#### Dependencies
- Internal dependencies
- External dependencies
- Risk mitigation

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance benchmarks
- Security standards
- Scalability requirements
- Reliability targets

## 6. Technical Architecture Considerations
- System constraints
- Technology stack preferences
- Integration requirements

## 7. Implementation Roadmap
- Feature prioritization
- Development phases
- Release timeline

## 8. Success Metrics and KPIs
- User adoption metrics
- Performance indicators
- Business impact measures
```

### Step 4: Feature Validation
For each defined feature, validate:

1. **Independence Test**
   - Can this feature be built without other features?
   - Does it have clear boundaries?
   - Are dependencies explicitly defined?

2. **Testability Assessment**
   - Are acceptance criteria measurable?
   - Can automated tests be written?
   - Are error scenarios defined?

3. **Idempotency Check**
   - Does repeated execution produce same results?
   - Are side effects controlled?
   - Is state management clear?

### Step 5: Quality Assurance
1. **Feature Consistency**
   - Ensure all features follow the same specification format
   - Verify naming conventions are consistent
   - Check that acceptance criteria are specific and measurable

2. **Coverage Analysis**
   - Confirm all business requirements are addressed
   - Verify no gaps in user workflows
   - Ensure edge cases are considered

3. **Technical Feasibility**
   - Validate technical requirements are realistic
   - Confirm integration points are well-defined
   - Assess resource requirements

### Step 6: Output Generation
1. **Create Enhanced PRD**
   - Generate comprehensive document following the structure above
   - Ensure each feature meets the idempotent, independent, testable criteria
   - Include detailed acceptance criteria and test scenarios

2. **Feature Summary**
   - Create a feature index with brief descriptions
   - Number features consistently (feature_001, feature_002, etc.)
   - Provide cross-references between related features

## Expected Outputs

### Primary Output
- **Enhanced PRD**: Complete product requirements document saved as `prd.md`

### Supporting Outputs
- **Feature Index**: List of all features with IDs and descriptions
- **Dependency Map**: Visual or textual representation of feature dependencies
- **Test Scenario Summary**: Overview of testing approach for each feature

## Quality Gates
Before completing this command, ensure:

- [ ] All features are numbered and clearly defined
- [ ] Each feature has specific acceptance criteria
- [ ] Dependencies between features are minimal and explicit
- [ ] Technical requirements are realistic and measurable
- [ ] User scenarios cover main workflows and edge cases
- [ ] Non-functional requirements are quantified
- [ ] Implementation roadmap is logical and achievable

## Integration with Development Workflow
This enhanced PRD will serve as input for:
- `c01-environment-setup.md`: Technical environment preparation
- `c02-feature-creator.md`: Feature specification breakdown
- `c03-dataset-generator.md`: Test data creation
- Subsequent development and testing commands

## Notes for Claude Code
- Focus on creating clear, actionable feature definitions
- Ensure features can be independently developed and tested
- Prioritize measurable outcomes over vague requirements
- Consider both technical feasibility and business value
- Maintain consistency in feature specification format
